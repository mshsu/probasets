Pink haired girl steals pro-life sign,"sorry man, looks like the calpoly subreddit wasnt exactly the audience u thought it was LMAO"
Pink haired girl steals pro-life sign,ik they thought it was full of fellow trumpers but they were mistaken i guess smh
Pink haired girl steals pro-life sign,Good to know cal poly students support theft of property because they can't handle political differences. Wouldn't expect much less from you children. Sad.
Pink haired girl steals pro-life sign,[deleted]
Pink haired girl steals pro-life sign,"I'd just like to note that OP has made it very clear through his post history about the COVID vaccines that he is absolutely in favor of ""My body, my choice"" and is also in favor of belittling anybody that says anything different. Based on that, I'm going to assume that he posted this as a way of commending this girl for her act"
Pink haired girl steals pro-life sign,"Oh wow I just recognized the user that posted this 😂 Yeah this guy's a clown, he came to Cal Poly because he was scared that UCSB would be too liberal. I've had the displeasure of interacting with him on this sub before. It's unfortunate that we still have to deal with people like this"
Pink haired girl steals pro-life sign,"[OP's recent comment about the same exhibition on another post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CalPoly/comments/si35da/cal_poly_anti_planned_parenthood_club_pink_crosses/hv6l2xk?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3)Yeah, this post about it was definitely nothing but objective, with no ulterior motive or connotation, right?  For someone who likes to ""go outside"" you sure lurk a lot on Reddit with this account which is likely a throwaway for all your anti-vaccine pro-forced-birth nonsense. It's unfortunate we have the displeasure of sharing the same university with people like you.I hope you have the day you deserve."
Pink haired girl steals pro-life sign,Came across this post from another sub but just wanted to say “I hope you have the day you deserve” is an iconic response

Pink haired girl steals pro-life sign,"She god rid of a shitty ad that has no place at school, good for her."
Pink haired girl steals pro-life sign,I mean it's a stupid take but everyone has the right to believe what they want and signs are symbolic speech
Pink haired girl steals pro-life sign,I'm an alumni but I'd be more than happy to meet up with a group of people to clean up that mess of litter on the lawn.
Pink haired girl steals pro-life sign,This post is backfiring on you.You just made her even more popular and cool for doing this.Y’all are trying to steal her rights of bodily autonomy and get upset when she steals your sign. Might wanna rethink your life choices boss.
Pink haired girl steals pro-life sign,Dude calm down
Pink haired girl steals pro-life sign,[deleted]
Pink haired girl steals pro-life sign,The irony here is that a person without a vagina is carrying a pro life sign… he does not know … Women would not have a sign about vasectomy or anything related to male genitalia’s
Pink haired girl steals pro-life sign,"OMG....I love the idea of having an anti-abortion demonstration, where we only circulate information about vasectomy.  Then we'd hear all about bodily autonomy...."
Pink haired girl steals pro-life sign,"How dare you assume his gender you bigot! In all seriousness though, knowledge and identity are different and separable and empathy exists. Ergo, men can certainly have opinions on something like this. Also feel free to make as many vasectomy signs as you want, we don’t care. Finally it’s not that hard to avoid getting pregnant under normal circumstances. Only 5% of abortions performed are due to incest, rape, or endangering the life of the mother. The other 95% are for convenience. Make of that what you will."
Pink haired girl steals pro-life sign,The sign was obviously supposed to be in the trash from the start. She just saved them the trouble
Pink haired girl steals pro-life sign,That high five was satisfying lol
Pink haired girl steals pro-life sign,She’s just cleaning up trash?
Pink haired girl steals pro-life sign,"She’s a legend, an icon, and she is the moment"
Pink haired girl steals pro-life sign,She doesn’t even break stride.
Pink haired girl steals pro-life sign,This is literally the funniest thing and this is the shit that makes me love Reddit. OP expected everyone to hate on the video with him and he got absolutely bodied and I couldn’t ask for anything better

Pink haired girl steals pro-life sign,"Me, a radical extremist : pro mandatory abortion"
Pink haired girl steals pro-life sign,"I think you got that wrong, Right: pro-birth.  They don't care about quality of life as soon as birth happens, otherwise they would be pro-education, pro-birth control, pro-community support programs, pro-women having autonomy over their bodies."

Pink haired girl steals pro-life sign,"What is wrong with what she did? She was putting litter away?Also, did these people even get permission from the university to do any of this, on dexter?"
Pink haired girl steals pro-life sign,AS SHE SHOULD. we don't tell u what to do with your penises! no uterus no choice!
Pink haired girl steals pro-life sign,⚠️ we got a gangster on campus ⚠️
Pink haired girl steals pro-life sign,Freedom of expression
Pink haired girl steals pro-life sign,based
Pink haired girl steals pro-life sign,"At the risk of getting downvoted, I’d just like to point out that she took someone else’s property and destroyed it because she didn’t like it. Now, I’m _staunchly_ pro-choice, and I get as irritated as anyone when I see pro-lifers, but that doesn’t entitle me to confiscate any of their property any more than they’re entitled to take mine. If you turn things into a situation where you’re just forcibly silencing your political foes, then the narrative will eventually be in the hands of whoever can wield the most force."
Pink haired girl steals pro-life sign,yeah the marketplace of ideas will surely settle the issue of abortion
Pink haired girl steals pro-life sign,"The only rational response I’ve seen, It’s worrisome this was downvoted"
Pink haired girl steals pro-life sign,"I get she has freedom of speech but she could've just ignored it and let the pro-lifers keep doing what they were doing. It might be a minority opinion but that doesn't mean we should take their stuff. In a different reality it could be the opposite where the pro life people destroy the pro choice signs and the reaction from all of us would be different. Once again, just playing devil's advocate cus there's free speech on both sides."
Pink haired girl steals pro-life sign,> In a different reality it could be the opposite where the pro life people destroy the pro choice signs and the reaction from all of us would be differentAs opposed to our reality where the pro life people firebomb planned parenthoods?
Pink haired girl steals pro-life sign,Lmao politics aside it's hilarious we have a bunch of grown up cry-babies in our society (both sides)
Pink haired girl steals pro-life sign,"being a centrist gets you shit from both directions, have fun"
Pink haired girl steals pro-life sign,I agree everybody needs to live their life stop being so involved with peoples choices in life as long as nobody is getting hurt or dying mind ya business and keep it moving 7billion humans on this earth everybody can’t be and shouldn’t be the same aside from the rules and regulations in place for peoples safety …. We just need to live and let live and treat each other with respect
Pink haired girl steals pro-life sign,Might get a lot of lashes for this but this doesn't seem civil at all... It's taking others' properties to dump simply because you disagree with their views. There are better ways to support pro-choice than vandalism :/
Pink haired girl steals pro-life sign,"Pro life group doesn't own the land, as far as we know it's legally litter so it belongs in the garbage."
Pink haired girl steals pro-life sign,this is hardly vandalism lol. also your deification of property tells me ur a victim of propaganda
Pink haired girl steals pro-life sign,"To be fair, it seems like there was come type of confrontation with the guy \[I'm totally assuming it was a white guy-OP-please correct me if I am wrong, and I will apologize for the erroneous generalization) prior to what was filmed-considering the videographer obviously knew what was coming, and it looks like the girl flipped off the camera as she walked by.  I'm curious what the sign actually said though; because if it literally just said ""Pro-Life"", then I would agree if it was posted in conjunction with Cal Poly posting regulations, it was inappropriate to remove and trash it.Edit: I just pulled the reservation history in 25Live, and that space was not reserved for this demonstration per campus policy.  Since this demonstration was carried out in a manner that was not consistent with campus policy for space use, I retract my prior opinion that it was inappropriate for this student to remove the sign.  She was perfectly within her rights-in fact, she was rectifying the violation of policy enacted by the demonstrators."
Pink haired girl steals pro-life sign,OPs a liberal
Pink haired girl steals pro-life sign,"Imagine if this situation was reversed and someone stole a pro-choice sign and put it in the trash. This thread would be a lot different. Instead of shutting down ideas we disagree with we need to have constructive dialog. This would have turned out a lot differently if the two sides could have had a civil conversation there on Dexter lawn. Instead the action has resulted in a lot of petty and childish comments on this thread and just more entrenchment in polar ideologies. It's embarrassing to see fellow alumni, who theoretically are educated at one of the best universities in the world, making such menial and basic comments on this thread."
Pink haired girl steals pro-life sign,Both sides aren’t the same. You can just “imagine if roles were reversed” it and be like humph I’m embarrassed people are cheering this on.
Pink haired girl steals pro-life sign,"Do you think it might be a lot different because pro-life people force women to give birth to unwanted babies and aren't actually FOR life while pro-choice people want women to have a choice to do what they want with their lives and bodies ? There is no middle ground on this, either you are okay with people having abortions or you're not."
Pink haired girl steals pro-life sign,"If someone threw out a pro choice sign, and planted a bunch of antichrist symbols in the grass or whatever PLers think they would, I'd still support throwing it away. It's litter."
Pink haired girl steals pro-life sign,Bro people just need to not steal peoples shit
Pink haired girl steals pro-life sign,WON'T SOMEBODY THINK OF THE PROPERTY DAMAGE???
Pink haired girl steals pro-life sign,Yeah like their right to make choices about their own bodies
Pink haired girl steals pro-life sign,Don't put shit on public property if you don't want it in the fucking garbage.
Pink haired girl steals pro-life sign,That may be someone's shit but it's not on their property. So it's just litter.

Pink haired girl steals pro-life sign,Yeah next time just don’t be in California. Cesspool
Pink haired girl steals pro-life sign,"Pink hair? Let me guess... you have pronouns, too? 🙄"
Pink haired girl steals pro-life sign,It’s all good if you don’t have pronouns tbh You’re a punk ass / bitch anyways
Pink haired girl steals pro-life sign,"every*thing* has a pronoun. and so do you. so, yeah, good guess, I suppose?"
Pink haired girl steals pro-life sign,You’re in college right? You might need to take another English class
Pink haired girl steals pro-life sign,"A pronoun is a word that can replace a noun in a sentence. I hate to break it to you, but unless people ONLY call you by your name, you have pronouns too."
Pink haired girl steals pro-life sign,Wait until you hear about verbs
Pink haired girl steals pro-life sign,course of you pronouns blue and hair have
Pink haired girl steals pro-life sign,What is wrong with having pink hair???
Pink haired girl steals pro-life sign,"Because you don't have pronouns, obviously."
Pink haired girl steals pro-life sign,Good for her
Pink haired girl steals pro-life sign,You the goat OP 🐐
Pink haired girl steals pro-life sign,This post aged well. All the idiots from cal poly now know that it's not a right.
Pink haired girl steals pro-life sign,Good! Go pink hair girl!!
Cough cough,Woah man chill out with the coughing
Can we have this logo instead,"Hi u/MagneticDipoleMoment, the Cal Poly administration regrets to inform you that the logo you have submitted is too professional and would scare away potential ~~customers~~ students. We were looking for something that garners less respect and is far more costly to produce. This logo also does not have any crossed tools on it and does not have **LEARN BY DOING** written on it in a bold font, so it does not present our brand as the *prestigious* university that Cal Poly is.The administration will consider your logo proposal if the grievances above are addressed."

Anyone else have only fans and really hot?,damn this gotta be a top tier misleading title
Anyone else have only fans and really hot?,Right?? Lol? I read it twice
Anyone else have only fans and really hot?,Dude damn. Legit thought it was clickbait😅
Anyone else have only fans and really hot?,I really appreciate that OP does not acknowledge the joke and also legitimately needed cooling advice
Anyone else have only fans and really hot?,"Dope title, have you tried out Vornado fans? They move a little more air and you can get a small draft going depending on the room"
Anyone else have only fans and really hot?,my gf took mine for work because she works in like 100+ degrees.  :( but i might get another one
Anyone else have only fans and really hot?,You're fooling no one and I respect that
Anyone else have only fans and really hot?,False advertising
Anyone else have only fans and really hot?,"We get about 20 days of pretty miserable heat spanning Sept and Oct. Head to the beach, spray water mist into your room fan to evaporate and lower the temp by about 5-10 degrees. Make friends with someone with a pool. Take a few cool showers. Sleep naked. Wet your shirt and wrong out the excess and the evaporation will keep it really cool. Find cooler cities to spend the day (Pismo, Morro Bay). Go to a mid-day matinee movie for a few bucks and sleep in the air-conditioned darkness."
Anyone else have only fans and really hot?,On a serious note what would someone recommend for an AC
Anyone else have only fans and really hot?,"Cheap option is a vornado fan and literal bags of ice. I did this in the dorms.Expensive option is a portable honeywell AC unit, which can get a lot cheaper if bought used."
Anyone else have only fans and really hot?,Who wants to proclaim the best OF model of Cal Poly this month 🌽🎥🥺 comment below
Anyone else have only fans and really hot?,Your mom
Anyone else have only fans and really hot?,"I’ve been in slo for four summers now. This kind of heat happens once every five years. That being said, when it does happen it’s fucking miserable. I found it worthwhile to take a half-day trip over to morro bay, where the high was only 76 yesterday."
Anyone else have only fans and really hot?,they also have fosters freeze which has good malts
Anyone else have only fans and really hot?,"Slo had it's record heat in sep 2020, over 110 degreeshttps://www.extremeweatherwatch.com/cities/san-luis-obispo"
Anyone else have only fans and really hot?,"Nah. This has happened more than every five years. And it’s going to happen more and more frequently. That’s just the reality of climate change. Also, just remember, if Cal Poly does actually switch to semesters, the reality of a town that has less than ubiquitous AC is going to suck. Yeah, there’s usually a week or two in October that are hot, but not like if school starts in August. Then you’ll have the temp spikes in August, September, and October. Another reason to oppose the switch."
Anyone else have only fans and really hot?,The high heat is only a select number of days out of the year. The usual approach is just to wait.
Anyone else have only fans and really hot?,"You get a 20000 btu portable ac that you can roll around, and setup an exhaust in the window."
Anyone else have only fans and really hot?,any specific brand recommendations?
Anyone else have only fans and really hot?,would they work with a horizontal closing window
Anyone else have only fans and really hot?,Swamp coolers also work pretty well here and you don’t need a window.
Anyone else have only fans and really hot?,how cool do they make things?  my gf hates them because her dad had one and it just made things muggy
Anyone else have only fans and really hot?,"In the evening, if you open only two windows, one on each side of your apartment/house, and set up a box fan blowing OUT one of them, it will suck the hot air out of your house and draw cooler air in the other window."
Anyone else have only fans and really hot?,good idea thanks
Anyone else have only fans and really hot?,[deleted]
Anyone else have only fans and really hot?,i don't have a usable window in my room.  can't really use any window units
Anyone else have only fans and really hot?,Try placing a pot of cool water in front of your fan. Even better if it’s something like terra cotta. The evaporative effect of the fan blowing on the water should help a bit.
Anyone else have only fans and really hot?,Hit the movie theaters during the worst of it. When home make sure you study up on air flow mechanics and drink plenty of hydrolites. https://www.cnet.com/home/energy-and-utilities/your-fan-is-probably-in-the-wrong-spot-move-it-here-to-really-beat-the-heat/
Anyone else have only fans and really hot?,Cold packs under the arms will help you stay cool. That’s what my parter and I have been doing the past week to stay cool 🥵🥶
Anyone else have only fans and really hot?,ok this was great.  me and my gf stuck ice packs in our pillow cases and are laying down.  I'll try the under arms thing when i want to get up
Anyone else have only fans and really hot?,I was concerned for a second after reading that title…
Anyone else have only fans and really hot?,No click baiting!
Anyone else have only fans and really hot?,I got one at Costco which is a like standalone unit on the flor that has a hose to push the heat out the window
Anyone else have only fans and really hot?,does it work with horizontal sliding windows?

"Hi all, I rebuilt polyratings... the new site is calpolyratings.com","Just added 700 teachers and 4000 posts pulled from polyratings, thanks for your input"
"Hi all, I rebuilt polyratings... the new site is calpolyratings.com",Agreed. You could segregate the two ratings into old and new and deprecate the old after each teacher hits a certain amount of ratings. 
"Hi all, I rebuilt polyratings... the new site is calpolyratings.com","For the love of all things holy pls open source this. Given the community of engineers and the fact that this is ummm oh yeah Cal Poly, people will be more than willing to contribute, making it a better website, and ultimately an adoptable system."
"Hi all, I rebuilt polyratings... the new site is calpolyratings.com","This is awesome, thank you! I’ll start putting in some ratings "
"Hi all, I rebuilt polyratings... the new site is calpolyratings.com","I might include a disclaimer that your website isn't affiliated with the school. That might help with any potential legal troubles (I remember that PolyRatings had some trouble from the school, which were resolved by leaking those issues to a journalist). "
"Hi all, I rebuilt polyratings... the new site is calpolyratings.com","Hey OP, I see I'm a bit late to the party, but I'm the creator and maintainer of [Pass the Plebs](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pass-the-plebs/mhglgbabaleaegjhdcmfffkaaklpmjog?utm_source=chrome-ntp-icon), and I'd like to help you in building out the site if you decide to move forward with it."
"Hi all, I rebuilt polyratings... the new site is calpolyratings.com",Oh boy time to give Dr K terrible reviews all over again!
"Hi all, I rebuilt polyratings... the new site is calpolyratings.com",Excellent. 
"Hi all, I rebuilt polyratings... the new site is calpolyratings.com","Fabulous! Thank you! Can you please prioritize a plan to make this sustainable? Your open source plans are a great start. And maybe annually bring on additional, younger co-moderators/programmers. "
"Hi all, I rebuilt polyratings... the new site is calpolyratings.com","This is cool, thanks!"
"Hi all, I rebuilt polyratings... the new site is calpolyratings.com",Mods should update the link on the side of r/calpoly
"Hi all, I rebuilt polyratings... the new site is calpolyratings.com",You have a github link? I'd like to contribute.If you want to set up CI/CD I can do that too
"Hi all, I rebuilt polyratings... the new site is calpolyratings.com","Thanks for your interest, I'm going  to release on github in the next couple weeks. I could definitely use some help to improve the site"
"Hi all, I rebuilt polyratings... the new site is calpolyratings.com","Hi there! I graduated a while back so I can't effectively do this, but would other members be willing to post the link on the more current ""Class of XX"" Facebook pages? Even those who recently graduated may take time out if their day to add some reviews. Thanks for your hard work!!"
"Hi all, I rebuilt polyratings... the new site is calpolyratings.com","Realized I needed to change the difficulty and went back and changed in the review post stage, I guess it posts before confirming because now I have two posts on Hoover's page, one with a 1 and one with a 5 difficulty rating. "
"Hi all, I rebuilt polyratings... the new site is calpolyratings.com",I removed the first post. I don't know how I could allow users to edit posts after submitting unless requiring users to register with the site.  I don't think people would enjoy that though. It's enough work to just write a review for a past teacher lol
"Hi all, I rebuilt polyratings... the new site is calpolyratings.com",Is there a way to edit Prof names? I already notice somebody misspelled a professors name in the math dept...
"Hi all, I rebuilt polyratings... the new site is calpolyratings.com","Ill add a contact form to report any error, then I can go in and fix it. I'll see if there's any better way to handle these types of issues "
"Hi all, I rebuilt polyratings... the new site is calpolyratings.com",Can I suggest that you put the department abbreviation before the class number? Its easy for me to remember like EE 295 rather than the number first? Can you explain the function of the say something nice thing? I feel like people are just going to want to write their review then bounce. Also it shows up as -- if they don't fill it out which doesn't really add value to the review
"Hi all, I rebuilt polyratings... the new site is calpolyratings.com","This is great! I understand the idea of giving professors a fresh start by not porting old reviews but think that the site won’t see as much use if professors don’t have reviews right now. I’d personally like to see reviews ported from the old poly ratings site. Regardless of what changes you do or don’t make, thank you for all the hard work!"
"Hi all, I rebuilt polyratings... the new site is calpolyratings.com","so dope, thank you for doing this"
"Hi all, I rebuilt polyratings... the new site is calpolyratings.com",I would try and reach out to the poly ratings guy and see if you can either get his source code or access to modify the site. Or get access to query his DB so you can add it yours.
"Hi all, I rebuilt polyratings... the new site is calpolyratings.com","Please port over the old reviews, even if you need to identify them with dates.

My experience 3 yrs in,[deleted]
My experience 3 yrs in,"Midterms, to be quite honest, are anywhere between the beginning and end of be quarter. To me, it may as well be a synonym for “test.” At least functionally, I don’t think I’ve ever had an actual class where a “midterm” was really anything but a test or quiz that was worth a substantial part of your grade."
My experience 3 yrs in,"Statics had a midterm Tuesday Week 2. An ethnic studies class had a midterm Thursday Week 10, with a common Final the Saturday before Finals Week."

This,Petition to get  Ice T as the professor.
This,Petition to invite ICE CUBE as our Honorary Guest Speaker for the class
This,"While they’re not officially petitioning for a “Fuck ICE 101” class, a group of CalPoly students has been circulating a petition reauesting that the administration make in person classes available for all international students who need them to stay in the country. Here’s the link to sign it: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf91oqpZwj34sFkmeKObcfmLEjix709pjRsBCXQHjDPrlinMA/viewform"
This,"Thanks for the context, I was curious what it meant. Honestly can't imagine going through college without being around everyone, living together and doing dumb shit. I miss Mo's bbq, taco de mexico and woodstocks, so much more. The drive-in movie place is probably doing well. I hope all the local businesses are making it through covid. Except the bar scene was super clubby last time I visited, those can shut down."
This,I’v signed so many petitions I might have signed this one twice.. f it
This,"Tks for the link, much appreciated"
This,"Here's the real student petition, requesting the University work with foreign students to ensure that they have access to at least 1 in person course or independent study to remain in valid visa status:[https://docs.google.com/forms/u/0/d/e/1FAIpQLSf91oqpZwj34sFkmeKObcfmLEjix709pjRsBCXQHjDPrlinMA/formResponse](https://docs.google.com/forms/u/0/d/e/1FAIpQLSf91oqpZwj34sFkmeKObcfmLEjix709pjRsBCXQHjDPrlinMA/formResponse)"
This,"Email this morning from the Dean of CENG:> Dean CENG students, staff and faculty,I was shocked to see the news on Monday about the changes to the Student Exchange and Visitor Program with respect to virtual learning this fall.  I want to assure the entire CENG community that from the moment this was announced that we began working with the Cal Poly International Office,  with the Provost’s office, and with the CSU to understand what we need to do to ensure our international students can continue their studies with us on campus this fall.  Our international students are valued members of our community, and we stand in support of them. Always.> As we learn more, I will update the community."
This,"Apparently UC Berkeley did something like this, where we at??"
This,Then ice is gonna know where to find them...
This,Amen
This,[deleted]
This,Cause the US is much better place to live than a lot of other countries.
This,"You haven't been many places, have you?"
This,Because I’m inspired by the story of “You could qualify any job you want even if you have no prior experiences and the only thing you need to do is tweet 100 a day”
This,"Not as bad if you're asian because of the model minorty myth and job opportunities. Speaking of Asia, they're even more racist over there. As for Mexican immigrants, racism and oppression is probably better than more inhumane conditions in Mexico under drug cartels. What the US government is doing to them is terrible, but people take what they can get."
This,Some of us only coming here for studying anyway.
This,"If the purpose of a student visa is for the international student to solely study in the US, then having all online classes defeats that purpose. Just like all the non international students who went home spring quarter since they had no in person classes.I should add this is how the regulations normally are, they were just given an exception for spring/summer.Go ahead and downvote me to shit but it makes sense in my mind"
This,"I get what you’re saying, but here are a couple things to consider: People will be stuck doing online classes (likely on the other side of the globe) where the time zone differences will force most of the students from Asia and Europe to take class in at 3 am or something stupid like that. Secondly, for people that came from a less developed country, their internet access might be very slow or just straight up unusable/non-existent.Additionally, those students pretty much have to leave all their friends here, forced to endure the entire school quarter doing nothing but school work, unable to collaborate or just hang out with people who might have originally lived near him.Lastly, a lot of people already signed a year long lease in the US, and well, deporting then would........ you get the picture.Source: Was an international student during middle school before green card. This is what I would’ve needed to deal with if this happened then."
This,"There are students out there who are still stuck in the US and can’t come home because there are no flights home due to the pandemic and travel restrictions. Plane tickets are expensive, hard to find and traveling internationally is extremely dangerous. Not to mention they would have to deal with the time difference when studying online back in their home country. There are also students who are still in the US working on OPT and are now under the risk of being sent home. Say they go home, if the school switches to in-person, they would have to go back to the US or else their I-20 gets terminated, that’s more money and traveling. And don’t even get me started on the amount of unnecessary stress this is putting students under, especially if they are not offered the same educational support back home."

I think we can all agree,my housemate is having a party today against my will and idk wtf to do about it
I think we can all agree,Bro I’m so sorry that’s like a stress dream come to life. I’d tell him that one of the neighbors got wind of it and said they’d call the cops so it takes the heat off of you tbh bc you’ll still have to live w him after the fact :/ here’s to you making better friends this school year! And hopefully not getting COVID! :)

I think we can all agree,"Well we’re doing “online kahn academy” anyways, so there’s nothing to lose."
I think we can all agree,A lot of people have some inperson classes and partying jeopardizes the rest of the year not to mention other people's lives
I think we can all agree,If you’re living on campus there certainly is lol
I think we can all agree,That is the most selfish attitude you could have.
I think we can all agree,"Maybe not for you, but for students like me who have been diagnosed with cancer, are undergoing chemotherapy and therefore are severely immunocompromised, we’ve got a bit more to lose."
I think we can all agree,"ACAB, but I need help from them so I’ll snitch lol."
I think we can all agree,"""ACAB. I hate the cops, execpt when I need to cops to support my opinion and enforce the rules that benefit me""... See how that works? You're part if the problem just not the Covid problem when you think that way. Your ACAB and ""I hate cops"" is a blanket statement kind of like saying ""All black people, or all NorCal or all women"".  You're in college, learn more than they teach you and try! try to do some self reflection. It's hard but you're smart (got to be you're at Poly! I was once too) and can do it."
I think we can all agree,It's been months since this term has been recently popularized. How do you still not understand that ACAB refers to the broken policing system and not the traits of individual cops? You also seem to fail understand the ability to criticize a system while having to take part in it or it being the only option available. Ben Shapiro levels of logic.
I think we can all agree,You are tripping
I think we can all agree,Exactly smh
I think we can all agree,"Nobody agrees with this 😂😂😂. They can’t force us home, they didn’t last year. Classes are already online."
I think we can all agree,They can arrest you for violating public health ordinances tho
I think we can all agree,I think they can force everyone home if they really need to
I think we can all agree,They’ve already sent students home at other universities
I think we can all agree,Says who? They can make you wear a balloon hat if they want. You have no control BUT! to just go home.

Can someone @jeff on this one 😤😤,"Cal Poly's budget is accessible as it is a public institution. Compare the budgets of two or three consecutive years to see where they're gouging you. Tangentially, it seems to be a measure of a ""real institution of higher learning"" that it can survive financially without having a football season."
Can someone @jeff on this one 😤😤,Call Poly has never relied on their football team for pulling in a lot of revenue though
Can someone @jeff on this one 😤😤,"I did my grad work at a college without a football team; completely different feel on campus. Also, remember that $832 million that Cal Poly brought in (assuming some of it was actually cash and not garbage donations and/or ""promises"")? Some of that money was targeted at making sport viable, which is money not going to make your classes better."
Can someone @jeff on this one 😤😤,*emails Jeff with this and no other text*
Can someone @jeff on this one 😤😤,Doesn't cal poly actually have a ton of debt? Like that's what they were saying about needing to keep student fees for bonds right?
Can someone @jeff on this one 😤😤,"They didn't pay cash for all the new buildings so, yes, they are carrying a lot of debt. Most of that is the Cal Poly Corporation which runs housing and dining and has to pay the debt with housing and dining fees.There is also the Rec Center which is funded through a different fee."
Can someone @jeff on this one 😤😤,"Don't forget that Jeff increased with size of the admin by 40% after her arrived. He also gave generous raises to the admin higher-ups, all the time while denying raises to people in the trenches doing the actual work. He then stopped building classroom/labs and started building profit making items such as dorms and eateries. The problem you see now is that all the profit making things he did require students to be on campus, so they can be used to fund his initiatives. We all know all about how Cal Poly works because it's a public institution. But do we? No. The Foundation (or whatever they call themselves after corruption required them to change their name) was created as a separate entity that allowed Cal Poly to hide their financial dealings under the guise of being a helping sister organization for Cal Poly. Additionally, part the Foundation includes strong PR: they'll always tell you about the great stuff they're doing. The truth is that the Foundation takes a dollar from you, keeps fifty cents of that dollar, then tells you how great they are because they give you back the other fifty cents. Recall that that Foundation also gives Jeffrey an ""allowance"" of something on the order of $60k/year."

Thought this was topical,"God, just... fuck. I have lost almost all respect for Cal Poly during my time here for how fucking awful the administration is. If I ever do something recognizable to the school and they try to put me in that fucking video they show to new students, I will sue. This whole new thing feels fucking typical at this point."
Thought this was topical,"I am glad I am not the only one who feels this way. I always thought coming to Cal Poly would be joining this great community, but time after time the school has shown that they don’t care about us, only our money."
Thought this was topical,Administrators never make mistakes because there are always plenty of people below them to blame. It's part of the arrogance and power abuse associated with academic administrators.
Thought this was topical,Can someome fill me in?
Thought this was topical,"In response to this [petition](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe5hxB8aT2FnCmRxcd63oQrVGlzDQx1ME4wj3CzOJr4pXyiiw/viewform), Armstrong sent out an email defending his actions and was mad at students and faculty for having a seemingly (to him) unjustified outcryHe said that they received hate emails and a death threat which I think is wrong, but I think the petition makes fair points about how his connection with MSU basically gave her the job, and how shady things happened at MSU during her time there"
Thought this was topical,"Smooth edit on the hand there, homie"
Thought this was topical,"I mean while we're at it, would someone mind telling me why is that guy's salary 400k+ a year, which is more than what the president of the United States is making?"

Congrats tho.,"Glad it's not just me feeling bummed. It really sucks that 2020 grads won't get a graduation ceremony (even though Cal Poly keeps saying otherwise, I'm not inclined to be optimistic)."
Congrats tho.,You don’t think we’ll get one at the end of the year like the website says?
Congrats tho.,"If it makes y'all feel better, there are other colleges that didn't have a proper ceremony this year."
Congrats tho.,"We were assured by Keith Humphrey, VP of student affairs, that ""we want to assure you that we will invite all eligible Class of 2020 graduates to the next available in-person commencement ceremony."" on 5/8/20 in an email titled ""Important Commencement Updates"".  What a load of garbage, he lied straight through his teeth."
Congrats tho.,"I just assumed they would give 2020 grads this, or next weekend. It's been my dream to walk the stage in Spanos in June."
Congrats tho.,County/state event limits for covid be like:
Congrats tho.,"On the contrary tho, 2021 grads had to deal with online class for their last 4 quarters of college while 2020 grads only had it for 1. Trade off I guess? Up to you to decide which is better and how much online class affected the value of your education. like for engineering, missing 4 quarters of upper div lab experience really brought down the value of my education. I would’ve rather been a 2020 grad"
Congrats tho.,Trade offer:I receive: in-person graduationYou receive: in-person classes
Congrats tho.,The grass is always greener...
Congrats tho.,"I would have much rather had 2/3 of a normal senior year and no ceremony than the last 4 quarters and a boring, hot ceremony to be honest"

SLO Sheriff posted - then deleted - this cringy video yesterday.,"They're cops trying to do media, what do we expect? Not ACAB. They're trying cause lots of shitty cops make their jobs harder than it already is. SLO cops have to be about the most chill cops they are. College kids are dumb, but they're also a bit unruly. These seem like pretty chill sheriffs."
SLO Sheriff posted - then deleted - this cringy video yesterday.,"I’m from this area & I just sent this to around 10 of my friends & it generated so many texts and jokes. I am crying laughing. Some of my favorite observations:1. It literally feels like some type of parks and rec satire 2. It took me way too long to notice the third guy was doing sign language, I thought that was like some hand movements from the avengers 3. The guy that was watching them do body art was kinda into it then by the third “safe with us” was like can I please go4. The Latina woman holding her hands awkwardly out in front of her like this 🤝5. you know they told the Great Dane their name, race, and safe with us 6. How about find Kristen Smart instead?"
SLO Sheriff posted - then deleted - this cringy video yesterday.,Please spread it far and wide. I want it to go viral ✌100% felt the same about the sign language lmao
SLO Sheriff posted - then deleted - this cringy video yesterday.,"Hey friends, I wanted to share some things that aren't in the description of the video. (If you haven't read the description on YT please do)1) This was filmed in July. When SLO Sheriff's office initially posted this video they got a lot of backlash for not including masks. When they deleted the video and put up a ""sorry"" statement, they put that it was filmed in April. This was a blatant lie, and their way to quell concerns about mask wearing. However, it obviously was filmed in response to the George Floyd protests in June which means it was filmed after. I'm not sure if someone called them out, but it was changed almost immediately (within 20 minutes) to say July. Unfortunately I don't have the original screenshot, but you can see this if you click on edit history on the fb post.2) The dog is intentional. On June 23rd, 2020 (remember this was filmed just a week or two after,) a nosy SLO Sheriff's deputy went to investigate a business with its lights on at 11:30 PM. The person present was the business owner who works and lives on site. The deputy shot the dog, but thankfully the dog survived.  https://www.ksby.com/news/local-news/atascadero-dog-on-the-mend-after-being-shot-by-sheriffs-deputy3) Yes, the ""civilian"" actors are just other officers in plain clothes. 4) as someone mentioned on the initial posts, there is no mention of the LGBTQ+ community. The fact that they mention dogs while excluding voices of the LGBTQ+ speaks volumes. 5) SLO Sheriff's office have been involved in the deaths of several mentally ill people taken into custody. (One as recent as this year, a 62 year old Nipomo man) The county recently settled the murder of Andrew Holland, a schizophrenic man who spent 46 hours in a restraint chair. The settlement was $5 Mill"
