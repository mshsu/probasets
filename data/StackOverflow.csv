Thanks for your answer. You do have an interesting suggestion regarding solution 2. However, if I have a large number of data sets, I am afraid that I would have to send a large number of timestamps to the server so that the server can make the decision of what to send back. For instance, if I have 10 000 data sets, I would have to send 10 000 timestamps. I think I should be able to represent a timestamp using 16 bytes and say another 4 bytes for a data set ID. Therefore, I guess the data itself, for 10 000 datasets would be like 200k. This thing could grow to 150k datasets.",2010-01-14 11:16:29.120000 UTC,2056460,,Jason,0

Being wary of accessors is a rule of thumb that's based on good design judgment (about encapsulation, division of responsibilities, etc) but that's too often misunderstood as something that can be applied mechanically by looking at method signatures.
